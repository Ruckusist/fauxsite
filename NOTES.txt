4-15-18: working today on getting everything on the screen.
    1. react component.
    2. sass mixin.
    3. python API.
    
   1. React files are .jsx. They should be able to interact 
   .    with regular npm installed js libraries. I just need
   .    to do the hello world example properly. 1:11 start.
   .    react files are importing from each other properly. 2:12 end.
   
   2. scss* minify is working. and compile/export.
   2a. bootstrap from cdn is also working.
   
   3. Python... I think i want to use the dashapp reloading function
   .    in flask. so, dash app, and callbacks. or no dash app, maybe
   .    there is another way. google something.
