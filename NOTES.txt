4-16-18: working on Ajax client server realations.
    1. install and make axios work in npm and react.
    2. hookup flask CORS module for api calls.
    3. make flask reload on changes real cool like npm does.
    
    1. AXIOS is an async library for making API calls in javascript.
    .   the example for this is creating full javascript classes. This
    .   will be useful in other applications for sure.
    .   i still havnt figured out what ajax is ??
    .   this is not working. the instructions were for a docker setup,
    .   and im just not there yet.
    
    2. Flask CORS is installed and loading but the api stuff is undone.
    .   cant access CORS from react yet. but it seems to be loaded properly.
    
    3. need to do this. okay to make flash reload on page save, a different
    .   firing mechinism is needed, i will add these instructions to the
    .   README.md.

4-15-18: working today on getting everything on the screen.
    1. react component.
    2. sass mixin.
    3. python API.
    
   1. React files are .jsx. They should be able to interact 
   .    with regular npm installed js libraries. I just need
   .    to do the hello world example properly. 1:11 start.
   .    react files are importing from each other properly. 2:12 end.
   
   2. scss* minify is working. and compile/export.
   2a. bootstrap from cdn is also working.
   
   3. Python... I think i want to use the dashapp reloading function
   .    in flask. so, dash app, and callbacks. or no dash app, maybe
   .    there is another way. google something.
